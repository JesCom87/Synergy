### Computer Science
#### Layers of Abstraction

#### Number Systems

- Number Systems: Decimal = `0-9`, Binary = `0, 1`, Octal = `0-8`, Hexidecimal = `1-9` and `a-f`.

- There are Conversions for each pair.

- Each Number System has a: Radix, Base, Weight.

- The Radix is the number of Decimals in each Position.

- The Base is the same as the Radix.

- The Weight is the Base and the Power Of.

- The Power of is the number of the Position.

- Integers to the left, Fractionals to the right.

- Decimal: Has no Value.

- Binary: [1 = (on, yes, true, high)], or, [0 = (off, no, false, low)]. = `1 bit`.

- Nibble = `4 bits`.

- Octal: `8 bits = 1 byte`.

- `2 bytes (16 bits)` = Word.

- Hexadecimal: Prefix = `0x`, Suffix = `h`.

- Little Endian = Least significant byte first.

- Big Endian = Most significant byte first.

```
